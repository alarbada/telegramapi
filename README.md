## Simple Telegram API CLI program for getting channel messages

### Project requirements:

- python3 installed, preferably a python version compatible with Telethon.
- telethon
- nodejs.

### How to run:

Just run the following command:

`npm start`

If the project is run the first time, the telethon package will ask for authentication details. Once those provided, telethon will automatically save the credentials into a file called session_cache, so the next time the project is run one will not have to provide again any SMS code and password.
